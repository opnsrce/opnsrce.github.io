# Contribution Guidelines

## Commit Standards

This project follows version `1.0.0` of the [Conventional Commits Standard][01].

The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", **"REQUIRED"**, **"SHALL"**, "**SHALL
NOT**", **"SHOULD"**, "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and
"**OPTIONAL**" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC
2119][02].

### Commit Prefix

- Commits **MUST** use one of the following fixed set of prefixes:
- `feat` – a new feature is introduced with the changes
- `fix` – a bug fix has occurred
- `chore` – changes that do not relate to a fix or feature and don't modify src
  or test files (e.g., updating dependencies)
- `refactor` – refactored code that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `docs` – updates to documentation such as the README or other markdown files
- `style` – changes that do not affect the meaning of the code, likely related
  to code formatting such as white-space, missing semicolons, and so on.
- `test` – including new or correcting previous tests
- `perf` – performance improvements
- `ci` – continuous integration related
- `build` – changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- `revert` – reverts a previous commit. The `revert` prefix **MUST** only be
  used for commits automatically generated by `git revert` and **MUST NOT** be
  manually written or altered.

### Scope

- A scope **MAY** be provided after a type. A scope **MUST** consist of a noun
  describing a section of the codebase surrounded by parenthesis, e.g.,
  `fix(parser): handle null values`

### Description

- A description **MUST** immediately follow the colon and space after the
  type/scope prefix. The description is a short summary of the code changes,
  e.g.,
  `fix: array parsing issue when multiple spaces were contained in string`.

### Body

- A longer commit body **MAY** be provided after the short description,
  providing additional contextual information about the code changes. The body
  **MUST** begin one blank line after the description.
- A commit body is free-form and **MAY** consist of any number of newline
  separated paragraphs.

### Footer

- One or more footers **MAY** be provided one blank line after the body. Each
  footer **MUST** consist of a word token, followed by either a `:<space>` or
  `<space>#` separator, followed by a string value (this is inspired by the git
  trailer convention).
- A footer’s token **MUST** use `-` in place of whitespace characters, e.g.,
  `Acked-by` (this helps differentiate the footer section from a multi-paragraph
  body). An exception is made for `BREAKING CHANGE`, which **MAY** also be used
  as a token.
- A footer’s value **MAY** contain spaces and newlines, and parsing **MUST**
  terminate when the next valid footer token/separator pair is observed.

### Breaking Changes

- Breaking changes **MUST** be indicated in the type/scope prefix of a commit,
  or as an entry in the footer.
- If included as a footer, a breaking change **MUST** consist of the uppercase
  text `BREAKING CHANGE`, followed by a colon, space, and description, e.g.,
  `BREAKING CHANGE:` environment variables now take precedence over config
  files.
- If included in the type/scope prefix, breaking changes **MUST** be indicated
  by a `!` immediately before the `:`. If `!` is used, `BREAKING CHANGE:`
  **MAY** be omitted from the footer section, and the commit description
  **SHALL** be used to describe the breaking change.
- When using `!`, the breaking change **MUST** still be clear in the
  description.

### Length Requirements

- Commit titles **MUST** be no greater than 54 characters.
- Commit bodies **MUST** wrap at 72 characters.

### Commit Message Content

Commit messages **MUST** follow these rules:

- The commit body **MUST** explain why the change was made, focusing on the
  immediate motivation or problem being solved by this commit.
- The commit body **MUST** describe the effect of the changes, focusing on
  outcomes rather than implementation details.
- The commit body **SHOULD** explain why the change was needed, providing
  broader context such as linked bug reports, user requests, or upstream
  requirements to show necessity beyond the immediate problem.
- The commit footer **SHOULD** reference any related issues, tickets, or pull
  requests using tokens (e.g., `Closes #123`).
- The commit body **MAY** briefly summarize what was changed if it is not clear
  from the prefix and description.
- Commits introducing fixes or features **SHOULD** note their user-facing impact
- All explanatory text in the body **MUST** follow the line length rules.
- Multi-paragraph commit bodies **SHOULD** be used to separate different
  concerns. For example, one paragraph for motivation or context and a
  subsequent paragraph for the effect or outcome of the changes.

### Example Commits

```text
fix(parser): handle null values in config files

Previously, parsing config files with null values caused a runtime
error during application startup. This commit updates the parser
to safely handle null values, preventing crashes.

This change was made to fix a critical bug that disrupted config
loading. It was needed because multiple production incidents were
traced to this issue and user-reported errors highlighted the risk.

As a result, users can now load configs generated by older tools
without errors.

Closes #42
```

```text
feat(auth)!: migrate to new authentication system

This commit replaces the legacy authentication system with a new,
token-based implementation. The new system improves security and
performance but is not backward compatible with the old API.

This change was made to address vulnerabilities found in the
previous authentication flow. It was needed because security audits
and user feedback identified multiple flaws that required a full
redesign of the system.

As a result, all clients must update to use token-based authentication.

BREAKING CHANGE: The old session-based authentication endpoints have
been removed. Clients using them will fail until migrated to the new
API.

## Content and File Naming Conventions

### Blog Post Filenames

Blog post files **MUST** be named with a date prefix for easy chronological
sorting in local development environments. The format is:

```text
YYYY-MM-DD-title-slug.md
```

Hugo uses the `date:` field in frontmatter as the canonical publish date,
but date prefixes in filenames improve sorting and file management.

Example:

```text
2023-01-22-tracking-your-work-with-daily-notes.md
```

### Tagging Guidelines

- Posts **MUST** include at least one tag.
- Tags represent **what was covered in the post**, not incidental mentions.
- Tags **MUST** be lowercase and drawn from a consistent vocabulary.
- Posts **MUST NOT** use more than 3 tags.
- Tags **MUST NOT** be synonyms of other tags (e.g.,  `docker` vs
  `containers`).
- Tags **SHOULD** be chosen from an established vocabulary to maintain
  consistency.

In addition to tags:

- Use the `tech` taxonomy for tools, languages, or platforms directly relevant
  to the post. Incidental mentions of tools **MUST NOT** be added to `tech`.
- Use `series` only when chaining multipart posts.
