I started making these cookies back in my college days and they've been a hit
ever since. Remember to take it easy when adding in the flour or you might burn
out the motor on your mixer.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup Crisco shortening
- &frac34; cup white refined sugar
- &frac34; cup brown sugar
- 2 eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 1 teaspoon hot water
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 12 ounces chocolate chips
- 2 cups old-fashioned oats

## Instructions

- Cream together shortening, white sugar, and brown sugar.
- Add eggs, vanilla, and hot water. Mix thoroughly.
- Mix in baking soda and salt.
- One cup at a time: mix in flour.
- Add chocolate chips and mix thoroughly.
- One cup at a time: mix in oats.
- Lightly form balls of dough and place on an un-greased cookie sheet, or a
  lightly greased (Pam) jelly-roll pan.
- Bake at 375&deg; for about 8–10 minutes. Cookies are done when the top starts
  to turn brown.

Let cool about 10 minutes before serving. Makes about 30 1.5-ounce cookies.

## My notes

The original recipe said not to use quick or instant oats. I used quick oats the
last time I made these, and they turned out just fine. The key is to not let
them get too brown in the oven. If they aren’t brown by 10 minutes, pull them
anyway. If they get too dark, they’re not as soft.
