A decent recipe for a variety of applications. Though, I admit I've only ever
made bread loaves with it. I don't have the patience or skill to try anything
else.

## Ingredients

- 450 g warm water, 86-90 &deg;F
- 7 g instant yeast
- 20 g sugar
- 20 g olive oil
- 15 g salt
- 680 g all-purpose flour

In baker's percentages (rounded):

- 680 g all-purpose flour
- 1% yeast
- 2% salt
- 3% olive oil
- 3% sugar
- 66% hydration
  
## Directions

1. Combine the warm water in a tall, lidded 6-qt container. Stir in yeast, then
   add the sugar, olive oil, salt, and flour.
1. Stir with a sturdy spoon for 15 seconds until a shaggy mass forms. Wet your
   hand and squeeze the dough until it is homogeneous.
1. Cover and rest at room temperature for 20-25 minutes or until the dough has
   risen by about 50%.
1. Refrigerate overnight (or ferment 90 minutes more at room temperature for
   same-day use). The dough can stay in the fridge for up to 7 days.

## Notes

I usually bump the salt to 3%. Refrigerating the dough for at least 48 hours
really does improve the flavor; I wouldn't skip it.
