I'll start with a quick note: I haven't made this in nearly twenty years. I dug
it up from my old site via the Wayback Machine, so I'm archiving it here.

I remember it being pretty good when I first made it. However, my taste---and
grocery budget---have definitely improved since 2008. Your mileage may vary.

## Ingredients

- 2 cans cream of mushroom soup
- 1 medium onion, diced
- &frac14; cup garlic, diced
- 1 lb ground beef
- 2 tablespoons black pepper
- 2 cubes beef bouillon
- &frac13; cup water
- 3 cups mushrooms, sliced
- &frac14; cup soy sauce
- &frac23; cup sour cream
- &frac13; cup milk
- 24 oz dry egg noodles

## Instructions

1. Brown the beef in a medium to large skillet; drain.
1. Add black pepper, onion, bouillon cubes, water, and garlic to the beef and
   sauté until the onions are reduced and lightly browned.
1. Add the mushrooms and simmer for 10 minutes.
1. In a mixing bowl, combine the cream of mushroom soup, milk, and soy sauce;
   mix well until blended.
1. Combine the soup mixture and ground beef in a large saucepan; simmer for 15
   minutes.
1. Stir in the sour cream and simmer for another 5 minutes.
1. Remove from heat and let stand for 5 minutes. Serve over egg noodles.
