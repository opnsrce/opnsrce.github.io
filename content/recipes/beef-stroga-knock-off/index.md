I'll start with a quick note: I haven't made this in nearly twenty years. I dug
it up from my old site via the Wayback Machine, so I'm archiving it here.

I remember it being pretty good when I first made it. However, my taste---and
grocery budget---have definitely improved since 2008. Your mileage may vary.
