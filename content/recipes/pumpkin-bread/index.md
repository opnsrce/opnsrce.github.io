I adapted this recipe from [Once Upon a Chef][01]. Technically, it's a quick
bread; in practice, it's basically cake.

## Ingredients

- 240 g all-purpose flour
- &frac12; teaspoon fine salt
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- &frac12; teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cloves
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1 &frac12; sticks (170 g) unsalted butter, softened
- 2 cups (400 g) granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 1 (15 oz/425 g) can 100% pure pumpkin
- &frac14; teaspoon ground ginger (optional)

## Equipment

- 8 × 4 in (20 × 10 cm) loaf pan
- Nonstick spray or butter and flour for the pan
- Wire rack

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325°F (165°C) with a rack in the middle. Grease an 8 × 4
   in (20 × 10 cm) loaf pan well (spray or butter and flour).
1. Whisk the dry ingredients: flour, salt, baking soda, baking powder, cloves,
   cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger (if using). Set aside.
1. In a large bowl, using a mixer, beat the butter and sugar on medium until
   blended. Beat in the eggs one at a time until very light and fluffy, 2-3
   minutes. Mix in the pumpkin; the batter may look slightly grainy, but it's
   fine.
1. Add the dry ingredients and mix on low just until combined.
1. Scrape into the prepared pan, smooth the top, and bake. Start checking at 65
   minutes, but plan for 80-90 minutes total. The loaf is done when a toothpick
   or cake tester comes out clean from both the center and near the edges.
1. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool
   completely. For the cleanest slices, wrap and rest overnight before cutting.
