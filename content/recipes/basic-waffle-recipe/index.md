This is just a basic waffle recipe taken from [All Recipes][01] and converted
into baker's math so my bread-making brain can quickly make waffles in the
morning and scale it up or down easily.

I know the weights listed here are crazy. I have an overly fancy kitchen scale
that's accurate to the tenth of a gram that lets me get away with it.

## Ingredients

- 250g of flour
- 360g of milk
- 75g of butter or oil
- 1 large egg (100g)
- 25g of sugar
- 16g of baking powder
- 6g of salt
- a whatever-your-heart-desires amount of vanilla

In baker's math that's:

- Liquid: 120%
- Fat: 31%
- Eggs: 1 (I refuse to weigh eggs for this)
- Sugar: 10%
- Baking Powder: 7% (rounded)
- Salt: 3% (rounded)
- Vanilla: one heart's worth

## Instructions

1. Pour batter into waffle maker.
1. Wait for waffles to be done.
1. Eat waffles.

## My Notes

The batter isn't overly sweet. If you want it sweeter, add more sugar. How many
waffles this recipe makes depends on your waffle maker's definition of a waffle.
For the one I've got, this recipe made about 5 waffles.
