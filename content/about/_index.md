I'm a software engineer based out of Vancouver, WA.

This site is my corner of the internetâ€”blog posts, notes, random links, and
whatever else feels worth archiving.

I have 20 years of experience developing software across a variety of fields,
including:

- Oncology patient data management
- Live auctions
- Retail
- Document management

Over 20 years, I've built plenty of weird stuff.

Tech-wise, my focus for the last decade has been in the Node.js, React, and
Redux ecosystem, but I like to experiment with new tools when time permits.

You can find me on [LinkedIn][1], if that's your thing.
